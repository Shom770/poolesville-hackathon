## Dev Guide
### Setup
Clone this repository locally with git.

### Writing Code
Checkout into another branch `git checkout -b [branch name]` and write code from there.
Do **not** write code in the `main` branch and commit there.

Once you write your code out, simply run `git commit -m "your commit message"`, and if it says that there are untracked files, run `git add .` to make all files tracked.

Then, run `git push origin [your branch name]` to push to your branch and you're done (remember to open a PR for your branch so it can be merged into main).
